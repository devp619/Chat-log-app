## Frontend development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. It starts both backend and frontend servers.
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` for frontend.
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build

## Mock api server

Resource urls `http://localhost:3001/members` and `http://localhost:3001/messages` serve the members and messages jsons respectively.
